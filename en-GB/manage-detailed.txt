        <p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant and suited to you and your interests.
            They’re
            also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
            effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with
            the
            website operator’s permission. They remember what websites you have visited and this information
            is
            shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting cookies will be
            linked
            to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
