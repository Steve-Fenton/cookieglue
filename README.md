# cookieglue

A working example of a re-usable framework for GDPR compliant cookie consent and script execution.

The basic premise is that you can write your own HTML for the consent management, with a couple of convention-based items being present.

Based on the names you use in the HTML consent management section, you can conditionally run or load scripts if consent has been given for them.

See index.html for more information or simple.html for a cut-down version.
